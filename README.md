# react-expense-tracker
### A practice/review Expense Tracking application built with React.
  
  
This little React applet allows you to enter income and expense transactions to then be displayed for you to review in both: a transaction list as well as a overview including a "balance sheet", break down of totals for each expense type as well as pie charts to help visualize the data you have entered.
